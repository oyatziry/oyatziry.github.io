                        Museo Egizio is an Egyptian museum located in Italy and is partners with UCLA’s Cotsen Institute of Archeology. They are currently experimenting with mobile applications to enhance the modern museum viewing experience. <br /> <br /> My team met with stakeholders and were asked to propose a versatile, mobile application that would engage users in the museum’s collections through social experiences such as VR viewing, scavenger hunts, and augmented photo filters.

            <p> 
                By conducting one-on-one interviews and surveys with Museo Egizio stakeholders and visitors, we identified essential application components for the mobile application. 
                <br /> <br />
                Facilitating discussions to identify goals and expectations of the Museo Egizio stakeholders was one of my favorite parts of this project because they had a lot of enthusiastic ideas to share. A common goal between the stakeholders was to create engagement between the public and the museum through the app. For instance, one stakeholder had a detailed idea to create a scavenger hunt component where the app would hold a list of collections a visitor would need to find throughout their visit.

                    Similarly, conducting user interviews and surveys helped us understand the museum visitor experience as well as the type of content and features they would like to see on the mobile app. For example, by knowing that the majority of museum visitors prefer taking a guided tour, we could implement an app component that can assist in providing tours which could come in handy for peak days/hours for the museum. 
                    <br /> <br />
                    In addition to interviews and surveys, we conducted a comparative analysis of other museum mobile applications to identify app components that are successful and those that are unsuccessful. Our findings demonstrated that in general the best apps fostered a strong relationship between using the mobile app and visiting the museum in person. When designing the app it was important that we found a balance between incorporating too little features that the app would have no long-term value and too many features that visitors did not feel the need to visit the museum in person. Our comparative analysis reinstated our goal of creating a mobile application that fostered engagement between the public and museum.
                    <br /> <br />
                    I was responsible for conducting both user and stakeholder interviews. I was also responsible for getting users to fill out our online survey.

                Once enough data in our research was collected, we created four user personas to help understand the range of experiences and obstacles that museum visitors have, as supported by our data. Our personas were key when brainstorming the components of the mobile app because they helped us empathize with the experiences of the Museo Egizio visitors. For instance, since our group of researchers were a group of college, tech-savy millennials, the personas were a reminder to also design with the perspective of a tech-enthusiastic adolescent as well as not so tech-savy baby boomers.

            <br />
            <h2> Design </h2>
            <p>
                Through a final analysis of our research, we decided on 6 main components for the mobile app: <br />
                - Tickets <br />
                - Tours and navigation <br />
                - Fun zone <br />
                - Museum info <br />
                - Collections <br />
                - Settings <br />
                <br />
                After these components were finalized, we designed the information architecture to get a better visualization of the structure of the mobile application.

                I was responsible for designing half of the low-fidelity wireframes and prototype. While designing, I really focused on the intuitiveness of the mobile app such that it is simple to use and contains universal symbols/icons.

            <p>
                The scope of our project was to conduct user research and propose a versatile, mobile application that would engage users in the museum’s collection. I took the initiative to create wireframes and a low fidelity prototype to add a visual element for our presentation to the Museo Egizio stakeholders. If I were to continue this project I would implement Museo Egizio’s style guide to create a beautiful finish prototype. Below is a sample of what I envision the app to look like.
